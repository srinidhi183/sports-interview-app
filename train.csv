11,Lacrosse,"Yeah, I mean, having them go out there and be aggressive, a lot of the credit goes to the scout defense.  Day-in and day-out they gave us a great look.",COLIN HEACOCK,Team,1
12,Tennis, I can't say that I turned it up because he doublefaulted three times.  I wish I could take credit for turning it up.,JIM COURIER,Individual,2

17,Golf,"You obviously love your chances, you've won it twice before, what is it about that makes this event so special?",COLIN CALLANDER,Individual,6

29,Auto Racing,"I mean, I think certainly early in the season that was a major factor. As the season has progressed, it's become less and less of a factor, but it's because we've had to adjust how we do business.",ADAM STEVENS,Blended,2
30,Baseball,"We've been talking a lot. Talk a little bit about baseball, talk about his workouts, and other stuff. He's in a good place.",ALEX CORA,Team,7

34,Tennis," Yeah, yeah, it's much better with my technique.  It's much better and now on I knew on hardcourt I couldn't play good.  I could play good, but now, I'm sure.",CEDRIC PIOLINE,Individual,2

38,Golf,"  Oh, my God.  (Laughs) I'm done.  It was a struggle today, especially off the tee.  I think I was spending more time with the crowd than I was inside the ropes today.  So being very fan friendly today.",LISELOTTE NEUMANN,Individual,2

44,Basketball,"  The snarl?  I kind of just did it.  I've never really made that face before, like ever in my really entire life.  Kind of just happened in the midst of things, in the moment.",TYLER HERRO,Team,7
45,Tennis," I don't know.  I haven't played on stadium.  But compared to the other courts, it is slower, yeah.  It is a little bit difficult for a serve and volley player to play well there.",RICHARD KRAJICEK,Individual,2
46,Baseball,"I echo that. When you have a place that you're proud of that you can go and say, This is such a beautiful field, let's all meet there, let's get together, the camaraderie, it's just amazing.",HEIDI WATNEY,Team,5
47,Golf,"  I'm definitely going to take some time off again.  I took a couple days off before this event, spend it with family.  I'm turning 23 on Wednesday and I don't know what I'm going to do yet.",BIANCA PAGDANGANAN,Individual,7

49,Tennis," Oh.  He is going to be tough.  I mean, he is very good player.  He is the top player.  So it is going to be tough.",CEDRIC PIOLINE,Individual,6

56,Baseball,"I truly believe -- we had opportunities today. We've been doing really well, driving in runs with men in scoring position; it just didn't happen today. So we'll come back tomorrow.",DAVE MARTINEZ,Team,4
57,Tennis, To early to get in any kind of sense for me.  I don't think I have that much of a feel for the tournament yet.,JIM COURIER,Individual,7
58,Cricket,"No, we're not practicing that, but I have some knowledge about that. So we share the knowledge with the girls, and we take the decisions -- I talk to keeper and bowler and one senior player. That's it.",CHAMARI ATHAPATHTHU,Team,1
59,Golf, I would say so.  Obviously depends on what we get tomorrow.  But I think these are the conditions you expect when you come over here.,ANNIKA SORENSTAM,Individual,6
60,Golf," Well, the 15 majors, but obviously that would be something very, very special.  I think so, yeah.  But hopefully before I get to 15, I'm up at 90.",ANNIKA SORENSTAM,Individual,2
61,Volleyball,"Yeah, it's a good question. I'm not the hiring authority, so I don't know, but I think it's important that we have really strong women in positions of leadership in our sport.",HUGH McCUTCHEON,Team,7
62,Tennis, I dived because I had to get the point and there was a little bit of luck and I got it.,CARLOS COSTA,Individual,2
63,Baseball,"I'm actually looking at him right now, he just walked in my office. We haven't talked yet. I'm going to find out his status. He's going to talk to you in a few minutes.",DAVE MARTINEZ,Team,3
64,Tennis," Yeah, I would definitely say so.  The approaches are also difficult to play in this kind of windy conditions, but still, I think it gives her more problems to pass me than for me coming in.  That is for sure.",HELENA SUKOVA,Individual,2

66,Auto Racing,"There was a lot of things that could happen with lap cars, him guessing wrong, me being able to run the bottom or run the top or get a good run or something along those lines. It never materialized. ",KEVIN HARVICK,Blended,2
67,Baseball,"Marisnick? Jake is an impact defender, he's got some base running skills that we can utilize hitting in front of the pitcher. He's got a little bit of history with Corbin, having done pretty well with him.",AJ HINCH,Team,2
68,Golf,"  It was fun.  It's nice having my brother on the bag, but it's cool.  This is the first time dad has caddied for me since I've been on tour.",AUSTIN ERNST,Individual,7
69,Tennis," Obviously, it didn't.  Usually I play pretty well when I have an injury, but normally I don't make it a habit.",STEFFI GRAF,Individual,3
70,Hockey,I think we obviously have to respond from last night.  It's always about what's in front of you.  Whatever is behind is in the past.  You have no control over it.,PATRICE BERGERON,Team,5
71,Basketball,"  Yeah, you know, we realized what they were doing defensive-wise, so we had a much better offensive output in this game, move the ball, move the ball, move the ball, and skew their defense.",BILL LAIMBEER,Team,1
72,Auto Racing,"Yeah, to be honest, we haven't talked all about it. I know he had a great run. I think we all respect his career beyond just that. Yeah, just trying to get better.",CHASE ELLIOTT,Blended,7

74,Golf,  Probably on 16.  That was the longest putt that I holed today.  It was kind of across the green down there by the water.,PERNILLA LINDBERG,Individual,2
75,Tennis," No.  Each one wants to do the best she can.  But we don't think ""I want to be better than my sister.""  Each one wants to do the best she can, but for herself.",MANUELA MALEEVA-FRAGNIERE,Individual,5

78,Baseball,"Well, we feel like we're -- two years ago now this next year we feel like coming into this next season that's going to be the goal. It should be when you have won back-to-back 97-game seasons.",BOB MELVIN,Team,6

81,Tennis," Not many people would, but if someone starts to mention, hey, this and that the other, I say listen I could careless.",JIM COURIER,Individual,7
82,Hockey,"Yeah, that line's been great for us whenever they're together.  Robby came in, brought some speed, some legs.  Looked pretty good.",ALEX PIETRANGELO,Team,2
83,Tennis, Not particularly.  I think surface probably suits him a little more than it suits me.  Probably more comfortable on this than he is on grass.,WALLY MASUR,Individual,2
84,Baseball,"Obviously very proud to have followed Fernando Valenzuela, obviously something historic, and something that I'm obviously very happy about, very happy to have followed him and to have done what I've done today.",JOSE URQUIDY,Team,5
85,Football,I don't know about it is remarkable.  I think it is a testament of what people can endure or persevere.,JOSH HEUPEL,Team,5
86,Golf,"Well, you're right, he was good in the No. 1 spot.  He was playing well, he likes to play fast, he was comfortable playing in the No. 1 spot.  Get out there and go, you know.",CURTIS STRANGE,Individual,2
87,Baseball,"Enjoy it. Honestly, it's stuff you gotta go through. I got a lot of advice from friends of mine. Kevin Cash, he's one of them. Something you gotta go through.",CHRIS WOODWARD,Team,5
88,Football,"  Well, I don't know if that's true or what it is.  I think preparation and opportunity, those two things combine, good things happen.",JOSH HEUPEL,Team,5
89,Basketball,"  Definitely feel a certain level of disconnection.  When you're here, you very much feel like you're in a bubble and kind of secluded and separated from the outside world.",DUNCAN ROBINSON,Team,7
90,Tennis, Is this the best win that you have ever had against a big player or have you beaten another top player?,RICHARD FINN,Individual,2
91,Tennis,"  I tell you tomorrow.  It is nothing knew to me.  I mean, I have been playing singles, doubles, mixed doubles at the tournaments, so it is no different than any other tournament.",HELENA SUKOVA,Individual,7
92,Golf," I will ask Tiger the same question after being the lead now at 6-under.  Some thoughts on your round today, and if you could go through your round card, if you don't mind.",JULIUS MASON,Individual,2
93,Basketball,"  You know, just being aggressive.  Taking the same shots that I took last game, and just having confidence in that.  My Teammates have confidence in me to score the ball.",ALYSHA CLARK,Team,2
94,Tennis," There was a serve.  It is difficult from the other side to judge a serve, but I felt it was out.",STEFFI GRAF,Individual,2
95,Baseball,"And one more thing to add, the humidors don't really address the issue of drag. The humidors will affect the coefficient of restitution, but sort of the topic of drag isn't likely to be impacted by that.",PEKO HOSOI,Team,7
96,Football,"  I think what everybody sees in them, they are very athletic.  They don't give up a lot of big plays and they make good plays.",JOSH HEUPEL,Team,2
97,Tennis, I am just going to let the Europeans do it because we are on deadline and if we want to go back to English we can.,RICHARD FINN,Individual,7
98,Lacrosse,"No, I don't think so.  He's a good defender, and I mean, I only one scored goal, so he did his job, I guess, and he played his position well.",RYAN LEE,Team,2
99,Auto Racing,"It was pretty clear??Ãª<U+0080><U+0091>cut. The 21 hung a left, drove those guys down below the line. We called that twice on the 22 car during the race, so nothing different there.",SCOTT MILLER,Blended,8
100,Football,"Well, it's obviously a different experience.  Something that I'll definitely remember.  Something  that I'll look back on with fond memories.",JOSH HEUPEL,Team,5
101,Baseball,"Melanie, thank you so much. I want to echo as well your dad, truly amazing and inspiring, Mike. Definitely want to thank him for all of his efforts, and obviously your whole family. So thank you.",JON SCIAMBI,Team,5

103,Cricket,"Obviously we played a lot of world-class Teams in this tournament. But this performance would probably be one to remember by the players themselves, giving them motivation, and also for the fans back home as well.",SORNNARIN TIPPOCH,Team,4
104,Baseball,"They positioned themselves pretty well. But we hit some balls hard. Trea hit a couple balls hard today, actually three balls hard. We've just got to keep battling.",DAVE MARTINEZ,Team,2
105,Tennis,"  It feels pretty good.  It is always good to win a Grand Slam title even in mixed.  I think very special and you only have so many chances to win them, they are good to take.",TODD WOODBRIDGE,Individual,4
106,Baseball,My mom is someone that I talk to a lot and obviously she helped me out this morning. We had coffee. Just gave me some words of encouragement.,JOSE URQUIDY,Team,7

113,Golf,"  It was a good settler.  I felt like I started fine, a little bit more steady than yesterday, so to roll that birdie in was good to gain some momentum for the rest of the day.",ALLY MCDONALD,Individual,4
114,Basketball,"  I'm doing the same thing.  I'm gassing him up.  I feel like I'm putting that battery in his back.  There's a lot of times I tell him, ""Don't pass.""",BAM ADEBAYO,Team,5
115,Cricket,"I think that's an Individual thing. Players have to pick themselves up. Management or anyone can go out and give advice, but at the end of the day, it's up to the player to go out there and execute.",ANISA MOHAMMED,Team,5
116,Baseball,"Let me just add to that, that when Lloyd says we have no idea, you could interpret that to mean that nobody in this world has any idea because, if Lloyd doesn't know, then nobody knows. (Laughter.)",ALAN NATHAN,Team,7
117,Lacrosse,"Obviously you can always shut the short.  So maybe give them something different.  Coach Conry was like  Nope, we're sticking to who we are and what we're all about.",COACH TILLMAN,Team,5
118,Tennis," When I am out there, it feels like it would be nice to know that I am a serving a little bit better and not miss easy shots at breakpoints, or game points or whatever.",MATS WILANDER,Individual,4

121,Auto Racing,"To be honest with you, that probably helped distract me through the majority of the week. Just being able to talk about something else, not being so caught up in a points situation.",ALEX BOWMAN,Blended,8
122,Hockey,"Yeah, it's been a long year, up and down.  All worth it in the end.  Obviously a little bonus scoring that goal last night, too.",CARL GUNNARSSON,Team,4

130,Baseball,"He was a very smart player, and now he can share the knowledge he has with the players that he's going to manage. Carlos was always well respected, well received, and I know he will be there, as well.",JOE GIRARDI,Team,7
131,Golf,"  I've never managed to find a comfort zone on this golf course.  It amazes me, but I think that's a tribute to how great of a design it is.",BETH DANIEL,Individual,8

140,Golf,I feel great right now.  What a beautiful day to play golf.  Braved the last two holes to kind of get myself back in the game.,ROSIE JONES,Individual,4

218,Basketball,"  Yeah, again, we're our own worst enemy sometimes.  Our turnovers tonight really hurt us badly, unforced turnovers.  We're in a good position.  They're a very fine basketball Team and you can't make those kind of blunders against them.",BILL LAIMBEER,Team,4

227,Baseball," I've got a bunch of family in town, so I'll probably just be at home and entertain all of the family that I've got in town.",ROD BARAJAS,Team,7
228,Golf, It was the same thing last week at Evian.  But I guess that's what we call experience and hopefully I will get that one day and I won't be so stressed in front of these girls.,GWLADYS NOCERA,Individual,4

240,Tennis," That means playing on the baseline and finishing the point with the winner, with the volley or something.  So the points will be longer than they were today.  And that will take a lot of mental concentration.",ANDREI MEDVEDEV,Individual,1

245,Lacrosse,"Yeah, I think it gives negative mojo to your Team if you think of how many goals you're down by.  Instead we take it, like I said earlier, play-by-play.  I think that's what got us out of that hole.",KENZIE KENT,Team,5
