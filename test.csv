817,Baseball,"  If you ask him, he would get an out or two or three or four if you asked him to.  I think everybody is going to have their spikes on tonight.  We have plenty of volunteers.",JOE TORRE,Team
818,Hockey,"At this point in time we're letting the dust settle in terms of what's ultimately going to happen with the remaining existing league, whether or not we've heard talk of the possibility of another league being formed.",COMMISSIONER BETTMAN,Team
819,Golf," I hit a 6-iron there.  Then I hit it in there probably six feet, making the turn, made it for birdie.",LOREN ROBERTS,Individual

824,Football,"  Yeah, it's true.  Before the Miami game, I asked him how it felt and he said, ""It doesn't matter, does it?""   I said, ""I guess you're right.""  That's the kind of guy he is.",COACH RICHT,Team
825,Auto Racing,"I mean, we saw sparks flying and everybody trying to avoid the mess that the 21 created. We didn't even consider much about the 17.",SCOTT MILLER,Blended

827,Baseball,"No, not at all. I don't think anybody was pressing. We got beat by the home run and they hit the ball out of the ballpark on multiple times and we ran into Strasburg. That's pretty much the explanation tonight.",AJ HINCH,Team
828,Baseball,"Start with the hometown Team I guess. You know, the Padres are hosting this thing. We got Kirby Yates over here. How are you doing?",HAROLD REYNOLDS,Team

834,Auto Racing,That's nice. I think we've had our share of ups and downs. Definitely more ups in the last month and a half than downs. So that's good.,ERIK JONES,Blended

841,Auto Racing,"  Yeah, thank you so much.  It was definitely stressful I guess four, five, six weeks.  I think at one stage we had about a 117-point lead.  It definitely started to dwindle away.",SCOTT DIXON,Blended

843,Tennis," Tell you the truth, I don't think any player likes hot, hot weather, really, but I am pretty fit, so I could play a couple of hours out there.",BORIS BECKER,Individual
844,Baseball,"I don't know. That's a good question. I can tell you one thing, winning is hard. Winning and getting through these series, just the opportunity of winning is really hard.",AJ HINCH,Team
845,Basketball,"  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  I have a support system at home that's taking care of that and that allows me to focus on my job.  So when I get home, I get home.  But I've got a job to do.",LeBRON JAMES,Team
846,Tennis," One time I had a breakpoint and it was a guy who said Mary, break her serve, and I will-- or the beer is on me, or something like that. That was kind of funny.",MARY PIERCE,Individual

852,Basketball,"  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I don't know what's going on up there with those columnists, but y'all need to take notice, I think.  Yeah, incredible to think what she's done through a couple of decades.  It's really unprecedented.",GARY KLOPPENBURG,Team

870,Baseball,"You know, I think it's hard to kind of fast-forward. Seasons end really fast. I don't care if you get all the way to the 7th game of the World Series. It's all of a sudden, boom, it's over.",AJ HINCH,Team
871,Auto Racing,"I think it could or it couldn't. You never know. I mean, it just allows you to get prepared a little bit better. ",KEVIN HARVICK,Blended
