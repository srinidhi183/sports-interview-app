588,Tennis," Yeah, I think it got a little tight particularly close to 3-All, I know when I served at 4-3 I played a really tight game, so, there was some nerves, obviously, that ball doesn't drop so fast--",GIGI FERNANDEZ,Individual,4

599,Basketball,"  We just started to turn the ball over again.  11 turnovers in the first half.  That's been our bugaboo throughout this season, against this Team, Seattle.  Careless turnovers.",BILL LAIMBEER,Team,4
600,Golf," Well, I could have hit that. I mean, it was that or my lob wedge.  It was really a lob wedge shot.  It could have been a sand, but it didn't worry me all the way.",GEOFF OGILVY,Individual,4

637,Tennis," Well, I didn't sense it at 4-1, then again it was 4-3 and 30-Love.  I think when I won the game to 5-3, I think that -- I felt pretty good at that stage.",STEFFI GRAF,Individual,2
638,Golf,"  I mean, I feel great.  I was hitting it really well this week, my driver especially.  I think I only missed a couple fairways all week.",MINA HARIGAE,Individual,2
639,Golf,  It feels good.  I just kept doing kind of what I was doing last week.  I love this course.  I really enjoyed my whole week here.,MATILDA CASTREN,Individual,1
640,Golf," I'm like, ""you're kidding me,"" or something.  You don't believe it; when everyone jumps up and down, it kind of doesn't register for a little bit.",GEOFF OGILVY,Individual,7
641,Tennis, I served better today than I did yesterday.  And I had a guy today who likes short points and also the difference was there about three hours of playing.,BORIS BECKER,Individual,2
642,Auto Racing,"  It's never easy.  Everything has to go into your favor.  The way it looked pace-wise, I was kind of saving a little bit of tires.  It was looking very good.",RINUS VEEKAY,Blended,4
643,Golf," I don't know.  What do y'all expect?  I'm not a real funny guy.  I guess Brad got the funny gene, I don't know.  He's a good old boy, though.",BART BRYANT,Individual,7
644,Golf," I think if you looked at my swing when I first came out to now, you would be able to tell the difference.",KARRIE WEBB,Individual,2
645,Auto Racing,"Well, I have certainly seen calls that looked questionable to me before in terms of what the driver did. Oh, probably going to call that.",CHRIS GABEHART,Blended,8
646,Golf," On 6, the par 5, I hit driver and a short iron to the green and a good shot that almost went in and tapped it in for birdie.",CRISTIE KERR,Individual,2
647,Golf,No.  Saturday after I worked with him I left that night back to Dallas and then flew up to Chicago.,BRANDT JOBE,Individual,7
648,Baseball,"  To be honest with you, I didn't go back there because it was late, and there was a lot of family on board and it was a little crowded last night.",JOE TORRE,Team,7
649,Hockey,"Well, first of all, it is about the players.  They're the ones that go out and do the job, play.  They've really bought into what we want from them.",CRAIG BERUBE,Team,2
650,Volleyball,"I mean, that wasn't my intention. I was just swinging at the ball hard. I knew that their setter was a shorter block than their middles. And I had some space on the line so I took it.",KATHRYN PLUMMER,Team,1
651,Baseball,"Yeah, if you have a Nats uniform on today and you're part of 25, I'm going to ask you if you can go. So we'll see.",DAVE MARTINEZ,Team,1

653,Golf,"Well, today it was quite windy.  I don't think the conditions we had last year was as bad as this.",ANNIKA SORENSTAM,Individual,4
654,Baseball,"  Well, that happened a few days ago and it's of no bearing on the game tonight, so I would prefer to just let that go.",BOB BRENLY,Team,7
655,Hockey,"You need the goaltender.  You need him to make saves.  I'll be honest, I thought the two goals in the third period weren't great goals.  He's got to make those saves.",GREG CARVEL,Team,2
656,Hockey,"Yeah, I asked them to take a look at it.  I was asked if I wanted to use my challenge.  I chose not to.",DAVID CARLE,Team,8
657,Baseball,"Look, I think we all understand and all certainly feel like we have a special group, a special Team, that's hopefully in the middle of a chance to do some great things.",AARON BOONE,Team,5
658,Football,"I think everybody takes something from somebody, so we've seen components of it.  Seen the mesh route.  I think they're the pioneers in that area, maybe the people that are the ones that do it the best certainly.",MARK DANTONIO,Team,1
659,Lacrosse,"I tried not to think about it that way.  I tried to just take one play at a time.  From experience, (indiscernible) and it caught me in the end.  So I just try to take it play-by-play.",KENZIE KENT,Team,1
660,Tennis," No, I mean, I'm very young.  I'm 22 now and I have many Grand Slams in the future.  You know, I wasn't too worried about it.",PETE SAMPRAS,Individual,2
661,Basketball,"  Yeah, just obviously they have two amazing players on their end of the floor and just the way we can slow them down to our best capability is the way we can win.",TYLER HERRO,Team,1
662,Auto Racing,"Yeah, I mean, I can't tell you. I typically don't get nervous before races, but this one had me pretty nervous because, I said earlier before the race, I've never felt less prepared for the battle ahead.",JOEY LOGANO,Blended,4
663,Tennis," Yeah, I felt okay.  I think it was just missing a night's sleep was the hardest thing, but that is the U.S. Open, I guess.",MATS WILANDER,Individual,2
664,Cricket,"Obviously very disappointed with the result today because of the rain, but you can't really control the rain. But really happy how we controlled the innings and built that innings and made a statement of how we can play cricket.",SORNNARIN TIPPOCH,Team,4
665,Golf," Yes, I hit a 5 wood off the tee in the right bunker short of the green, chipped up and missed the putt, 12 feet or so.",DAVID TOMS,Individual,2
666,Baseball,"I mean, I really don't look at the opposing pitcher. Again, it's who I'm facing, the hitters that I'm facing. That's my job.",STEPHEN STRASBURG,Team,1
667,Hockey,"Yeah, he has played a lot of hockey.  A lot of guys have played a lot of hockey.  But he's a worker.  He loves it, loves the work.  That's what drives him, makes him a great player.",CRAIG BERUBE,Team,2
668,Golf,"  Yeah, when he standing beside me he give me like a lot of confidence, you know.  He know my swing and we work long time together, so he know everything for me.",CHELLA CHOI,Individual,5
669,Football,"Kept us off the field, offense was running out of time and stuff, couldn't get our rhythm in, we wasn't executing.  They didn't do much and we didn't execute, so couldn't get our rhythm.",DAVONTAVEAN MARTIN,Team,4
670,Tennis," I think it was in Monte Carlo this year when I was in the final.  I beat Edberg in the semis, and even though it was not his best surface, it was a very good win for me.",CEDRIC PIOLINE,Individual,2
671,Volleyball,"I thought it felt for the most part pretty good. I thought, you know, offensively and defensively, we were feeling balanced. You know, we got a fair share of blocks tonight, and we were digging at a pretty good rate.",HEAD COACH HUGH McCUTCHEON,Team,4
672,Football,"  There's not time in the day.  Again, at the same time, you need to be very thankful for what God has placed in your life, and I am.",JOSH HEUPEL,Team,7
673,Baseball,"  Physically, he's ready to go in Game  7, he's going to get the ball.  That's not even a point.  (Smiles).",BOB BRENLY,Team,6
674,Volleyball,"Yeah, I think we all just made the focus of doing your own job, and as long as we were able to handle it on the server end of things, we made their job a lot easier.",CC McGRAW,Team,1
675,Tennis, I don't know.  Am I the only one who says that?  Because everyone keeps talking about. I don't know what is difficult to understand about it.  Just the surrounding and everything is very hard.,JANA NOVOTNA,Individual,7
676,Football,"  We don't care how a Team plays.  We're going to go up there and execute, and if we execute and take care of the ball, we are going to be successful.",JOSH HEUPEL,Team,1
677,Baseball,They had a lot of good at-bats. They pitched pretty good. And they got a good amount of hits. I felt all right and they made it tougher than it would ideally be.,ZACK GREINKE,Team,2
678,Basketball,"  We've got a chance.  We still believe.  They're writing us off.  Everybody is doubting us.  But as long as the people in the locker room and all our coaching staff have belief in us, that's all that matters.",BAM ADEBAYO,Team,5
679,Cricket,"Some legspinners, there's Sophie Dunkley, she can get a lot of turn on the ball; Helen Fenby, and a couple of cant players who are up and coming, so I'm just go to keep always pushing like I am.",SARAH GLENN,Team,2
680,Baseball,"No. Those are the guys I visited with. Well, I kind of visited with. One was via telephone. That's not breaking news, is it? Didn't everybody kind of do that?",JOE MADDON,Team,7
681,Golf, That one has been off and on in the bag.  The last time I won the British Open was with that one.,KAREN STUPPLES,Individual,7
682,Baseball,"Yeah, it's difficult. I mean, the postseason, like, you kind of know that those are coming. I knew in Game 6 against the Yankees that I was going to have one plus that day.",WILL HARRIS,Team,4
683,Football,"Well, it's never good to end the season with a loss, especially against your arch rival, obviously, but I don't know that it helps or hinders you going into a bowl season, regardless.",WILL MUSCHAMP,Team,4
684,Golf," You know, I've always kind of struggled at the British Open and I don't really know why, but I have.  But this is probably one of my best rounds I've played I know out here.",JULI INKSTER,Individual,2

686,Baseball,"He's a big boy, and I don't feel -- I don't think he would expect me to feel sorry for him. I think he can answer that question. I guess, if fans feel they need to apologize to him, great.",DAVE ROBERTS,Team,8
687,Baseball,"You know what, I'm not going to comment on that because, like I said, the whole investigation is in the process by MLB baseball. So anything related to suspension, the Astros, I don't have any comment on those.",CARLOS BELTRAN,Team,8

690,Hockey,"I read about it and hear about it, but it hasn't sunk in yet.  That five-win season is still pretty fresh, the pain from that season sunk in.  The glory of this season hasn't sunk in yet.",GREG CARVEL,Team,4
691,Hockey,"Not yet.  Johnny Moore played, Steven Kampfer played.  Johnny is a left stick.  Talked about that.  That's the easiest thing, keep everyone on their strong sides.  We'll look at that a little bit more.",BRUCE CASSIDY,Team,1
692,Football,"Just didn't go our way, there is no real answer for it.  We just didn't come out and do our jobs.",JALEN THOMPSON,Team,4
693,Volleyball,"Regardless of who we're playing, we always try to focus on our side of the net and focus keeping the ball high. That doesn't change against a Team with high blockers.",AUDRIANA FITZMORRIS,Team,1
694,Baseball,"I think normally you would like to have eight. To feel comfortable about breaking camp six weeks after the fact; having eight guys that have an opportunity to be in a rotation is the ideal number, right around there.",BRANDON HYDE,Team,1
695,Golf," A sand wedge, which is a pretty crucial club.  If I can't I'm sure I'll be able to borrow something off somebody.  The Tour usually travels with about 30 clubs each.",GEOFF OGILVY,Individual,1
696,Tennis," No, I don't think so.  We have talked about this before and you know for my tennis he is not going to really be involved with me anymore.",MARY PIERCE,Individual,7
697,Baseball,"Yeah, for me, SÃºnchie did a really good job of actually staying in the moment. Some of those calls he thought were questionable, but he didn't let them affect him. So he pitched well.",DAVE MARTINEZ,Team,2
698,Baseball,"Yeah, I mean, I've done it before. So this postseason is not out of my comfort zone, I guess you'd say, being a part of this Team for the last five years.",WILL HARRIS,Team,2
699,Baseball,"No, not these guys. Like I said, we fought all year long to get here. We played playoff games all year long to get here. But we have a lot in fight in us left. I know we do.",DAVE MARTINEZ,Team,5
700,Hockey,"It's what we expected.  We've seen it against Columbus a little bit, and Carolina was also a physical Team.  Nothing that we're not used to.",PATRICE BERGERON,Team,4
701,Baseball,"I know it's not going to be easy to get to the World Series. Tampa and New York are great Teams. It was a fun series, competitive series, and we knew that going into it.",MICHAEL BRANTLEY,Team,6
702,Football,"  No.  It's not what the trip is all about, and it is not going to help get prepared to play the game.",JOSH HEUPEL,Team,7
703,Lacrosse,"I thought, honestly, it was just a hard-fought battle.  I think it was like any other game.  Obviously, it was up-and-down.  The emotions were high.  Obviously the field was a little different dealing with that.",CONNOR KELLY,Team,4
704,Basketball,"  Yeah, obviously that crosses the line, if that's occurring, certainly crosses the line.  This is sports.  It's a game.  We all want to root for our fan bases, for our Teams, but certainly that crosses the line.",FRANK VOGEL,Team,8
705,Football,"  No.  Again, obviously, we would like to be more successful as an offense, but the thing we're concerned about is winning.",JOSH HEUPEL,Team,1
706,Tennis," Yeah, but I felt they were behind me, too.  A lot of people were yelling for me.  I mean, she is well liked everywhere, so that is pretty hard, but I thought I got a fair following here.",LINDSAY DAVENPORT,Individual,7
707,Hockey,"A couple hours, yeah.  Not too much.  I mean, it's kind of tough to go to bed after whatever happens in the game.  You go through a lot of emotions, a lot of things in your head.",CARL GUNNARSSON,Team,7
708,Baseball,"  We had not talked about it before the ballgame, but BK throws every day, he throws a lot of pitches every day.  It wasn't really pushing him beyond what he can do.",BOB BRENLY,Team,2

710,Golf,"Oh, I putted with that one all the way up until the start of this year.  I started this year with a Rossa but I putted with it last year.",LOREN ROBERTS,Individual,7
